PLEASE READ IT TILL LAST AND THEN JUDGE PLEASE.
key features of this project:
This is a online compiler that runs on my own programming language called minilang made through python.
1.You can use show <text> to print things..
2.to get input you guys can use getinp function
3.it can do simple mathmatical operations too 
4.some loops are also implement but those dont work right now

Note: This project is still in developing phase I will soon give an update to it its a demo project guys so, I have shared it with you even it has lots of bugs..
If some functions are not working I am really sorry for that I will fix them after my exams..Again its just a demo.. to show what am I working on guys so dont report:)
My exams are from tomorrow and submitting it after exams would be too late cause I dont have another project ready for highseas.




Why this project took so long to be made?
1. gone through more than more than 15-16 hrs of tutorials cause I didn't had much knowledge of making interpreter than can run games written in txt.
2. The codes were edited more than 100reds of times cause while one thing was working another wasnt...

Is AI used in this project?
yes I had to go through AI cause for bugs there were no tutorials and I had to use AI.Not for everything but for fixing bugs and things used to paste the code in AI and it would find the bug and give me the solved code and I used that and solve my issue.

About the project:
The project is a programming language made by me it's not fully functional but it runs two games but they have some bugs too tried to fix them but I am too much tired of them.
game no 1:
it's a cookie baking game. you guys have to add cookie ingredients to make cookie dough then you guys have to bake cookie and sell them and get points.
failed plan:
the idea was to make the game able to have dough that can make only 12 cookies and while baking user has to take out the cookies from oven before 20sec after 15 sec but that could not be implement due to various issues and i wanted to make a upgradeable oven too that also failed.
Running the game; The code.
cookie_game write this in the webapp coding area and you can play it in the output area..
game no 2:
it's was planned to be similar to a game called dark room not exactly same but things would work like that but there was my own story and logic you guys can search it in the web but it failed...

Running the game; The code:
dark_room..
